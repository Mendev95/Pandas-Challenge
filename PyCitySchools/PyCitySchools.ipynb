    "PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of PyCity Schools data provided valuable insights and trends that could potentially aid decision making. The data contained a total of 15 schools with a student count of 39,170 and a total budget 0f $24,649,428. The data looked at the performance of students from various schools regarding maths and reading. The findings and analysis are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Maths Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The data showed that about 75% of the students passed the maths test with an average score of about 79%. Overall, Bailey had the highest number of students passing maths with Pena High School having the least number of students. Nonetheless, this is influenced by the total number of students in the school. In terms of percentage Pena High School is the best performing school while Huang High School is the least performing. Overall, the Charter schools performed better as compared to the District schools\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The data revealed that about 86% of the students passed their reading test. Like the maths test, Bailey High School had the highest number of students passing their reading test while Holden High School had the least number of students. Again, this is greatly influenced by the number of students the school has leading to Bailey High School having 81% of its students passing while Holden has 96% of its students passing. Yet, Thomas High School is the best performing school with a pass percentage of 97 whereas Rodriguez High School is the least performing with 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation between budget and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights from the data show that the amount of money received by a school had no bearing on performance. For example, Cabrera High School which is the overall best performing school with 91% pass rate had a budget of $1,081,356.00 while Rodriguez High School with an overall pass percentage of about 53% had a budget of $2,547,363.00. This clearly proves that the performance of the schools is influenced by other factors. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that Rodriguez has more students and thus receive more money. The number of students could potentially affect performance as teacher to student ratio may not be ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The data clearly proves that Charter schools perform better than District shoes as they performed better in both maths and reading. Additionally, the budget of the school had no impact on its performance which calls for re-evaluation of resource disbursement and a nuanced approach to improve the performance of the Disrict Schools\n"
